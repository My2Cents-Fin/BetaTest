## Last Session Summary
**Session 40: Notifications — Use Case Definition (Product Design)**

### What Was Done
1. **Defined notification types** — Identified 5 notification types: (1) Release Updates, (2) Expense Logging Reminders, (3) Budget Creation Reminders, (4) Add to Homescreen Prompt, (5) Tutorials. Clarified which are push notifications vs in-app UX patterns.

2. **Release Updates — fully defined** — In-app "What's New" swipeable carousel (dismissable, one feature per slide, marketing tone). Content stored in Supabase table (no redeploy needed). Push notification to pull back inactive users. Show once per announcement.

3. **Expense Logging Reminders — fully defined** — Duolingo-style gamified approach with two tracks:
   - **Track A (zero txns today):** Escalating daily nudges across 4 time slots. Escalation persists across days (day 3+ starts aggressive). Resets only when a transaction is logged.
   - **Track B (has txns, contextual):** Max 2-3/day. Triggers: meal times, sub-category silence, behavioral (logged then went quiet), weekends.
   - **Tier 1:** Custom sassy messages for all predefined sub-categories (Income, EMI, Insurance, Savings, Fixed, Variable — ~30 sub-cats with specific triggers and frequencies).
   - **Tier 2:** Generic sassy messages for user-created custom sub-categories.
   - Every notification = Hook (sassy attention grab) + Action (varied CTA — Record, Add, Track, Capture, Punch in, etc.)

4. **Created notifications doc** — `docs/Finny-Foundation-Pillar/finny-user-journey-notifications.md` with all objectives, decisions, messages, triggers, and frequencies.

### No Code Changes
This was a pure product design session. No files modified in `app/`.

### Remaining Work (Notifications)
- **#3: Budget Creation Reminders** — Not started
- **#4: Add to Homescreen Prompt** — Not started (in-app UX, not push)
- **#5: Tutorials** — Not started (in-app UX, not push)
- **Architecture design** — Push subscription storage, service worker, scheduling (pg_cron / Edge Functions), schemas
- **Implementation** — All of the above

### Pending Discussion (Carried Forward)
- **Phase 4: Tab-Level Data Caching** — deferred from Session 38
- **End-of-month nudge** — Last 2 days: nudge user to set up next month's budget (now part of #3 Budget Creation Reminders)
- **First day of new month** — Land on dashboard even without budget (show CTA), vs auto-redirect to budget tab

### Previous Session 39: Bug Fix — Stale QuickAdd Categories + Destructive Orphan Cleanup Removal

### What Was Done (Session 39)
1. Fixed stale QuickAdd categories — sub-categories refreshed on modal open across all 3 tabs.
2. Removed destructive orphan cleanup in BudgetTab (data-destroying bug).
3. Deployed perf optimizations from Session 38.
- **Deployed to prod** ✅ (commit `7fc812f`, pushed 2026-03-01)

---

### Previous Session 37: Transactions UX Polish + Bug Fixes + Deploy to Prod

### What Was Done (Session 37)
1. Date group header color differentiation — purple-tint background for date group headers
2. Default to current month filter — Transactions tab defaults to current month with date filter pre-applied
3. "Showing X of Y" total count fix — count-only Supabase query for total across all months
4. Smart month subtitle — Shows month label when full-month filter active
5. Ghost transaction modal fix — quickAddTrigger auto-reset in AppLayout
6. Transaction modal field reorder — Date before Category

---

### Previous Session 36: Month Rollover Bug Fixes + Transactions UX Overhaul

### What Was Done (Session 36)
1. Income not saving on fresh budget — fixed transaction date to use selected month
2. Cloned income persisting on fresh start — added DB delete before reset
3. Future transactions invisible — removed `max` from date inputs
4. All transactions shown by default — changed from current-month-only
5. Transaction modal opening on wrong tabs — conditional trigger passing
6. Dashboard/Budget default to current month — wasActiveRef pattern
7. Collapsible date groups with auto-expand — ~10 txn threshold
8. Glass-card date headers — restyled with purple chevron, count + total

---

### Previous Session 35: Trust & Security Messaging Quick Wins + PROD Migration Fix

### What Was Done (Session 35)
- **PROD migration fix** — `original_narration` column missing on PROD Supabase (migration `011_csv_import_support.sql` hadn't been run). User ran the SQL on PROD SQL editor. Transaction creation + fund transfers now work on prod.
- **Trust & security messaging (Quick Wins)** — Added 6 contextual trust indicators across the app:
  1. **Login screen** (`PhoneEntryScreen.tsx`) — "Indian data laws compliant" with lock icon, center-justified below Privacy/Terms links
  2. **Bank statement upload** (`StatementImportModal.tsx`) — "Your file is processed on this device. We do not store any sensitive information." with green shield icon
  3. **Transaction entry** (`QuickAddTransaction.tsx`) — "Stored in your household's private vault, only visible to you and other members in this household" with lock icon below submit button
  4. **Fund transfer** (`FundTransferModal.tsx`) — Same trust footer as transaction entry
  5. **Dashboard** (`DashboardTab.tsx`) — "Your data: Encrypted, private, never shared" tappable indicator with shield+chevron, opens PrivacyInfoModal
  6. **Invite screen** (`InviteScreen.tsx`) — "Only household members can see your data. No one else." with green shield icon (only visible during new user onboarding Step 3 of 3)
- **PrivacyInfoModal integration** — Dashboard trust indicator opens existing PrivacyInfoModal (created in Session 33) directly from the dashboard

### Key Changes
1. **Modified files:**
   - `app/src/modules/auth/components/PhoneEntryScreen.tsx` — Added trust strip
   - `app/src/modules/transactions/components/StatementImportModal.tsx` — Added trust reassurance
   - `app/src/modules/dashboard/components/QuickAddTransaction.tsx` — Added trust footer
   - `app/src/modules/dashboard/components/FundTransferModal.tsx` — Added trust footer
   - `app/src/modules/dashboard/components/DashboardTab.tsx` — Added PrivacyInfoModal import, `showPrivacyInfo` state, tappable trust indicator
   - `app/src/modules/onboarding/components/InviteScreen.tsx` — Added trust reassurance

### Build Status
- TypeScript: ✅ Zero errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- Vite build: ✅ Passes clean

### Still Needed (from this session)
- Medium effort trust items: Data Export (CSV download), "What We Know About You" screen
- PROD migration `011_csv_import_support.sql` — ✅ DONE (user ran it)

### Previous Session 34: Uncategorized Drill-Down, Filter Enhancements, Excel Fix & Prod Fixes

### What Was Done (Session 34)
- **Dashboard → Transactions uncategorized drill-down** — Clicking the "Uncategorised" row on the dashboard now navigates to the Transactions tab pre-filtered to show only uncategorized transactions. Added `onUncategorizedDrillDown` callback prop to DashboardTab, `drillDownUncategorized` state in AppLayout, consumption logic in TransactionsTab with `filterUncategorizedOnly` state.
- **"All Uncategorised" quick select in filters** — Added new checkbox option in the CategoryMultiSelect Quick Select section. Amber-colored styling. Mutual exclusion: toggling uncategorized-only clears all other category/transfer filters; toggling any specific category clears uncategorized-only mode.
- **Dashboard uncategorized context** — Subtitle now shows "X this month · Y total" (only shows total when different from current month count). Added lightweight `getUncategorizedCount()` query using Supabase `select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })` to get all-time uncategorized count without transferring data.
- **Critical Excel import bug fix** — ICICI mini-statement XLS (`OpMiniStatement22-02-2026.xls`) was showing serial numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) as transaction amounts instead of actual amounts (337.00, 20.00, etc.). Root cause: the generic CSV fallback parser had 3 compound bugs — it parsed the date column as a number, picked up serial numbers as amount candidates, and the CR/DR indicator column confused both debit/credit keyword detection and positional fallback. Fixed the `GENERIC_CSV.parseRow` in csvParser.ts to handle both Pattern A (split Debit/Credit columns) and Pattern B (single Amount column + CR/DR indicator).
- **Identified PDF parser gap** — Generic PDF parser handles Pattern A well but has a gap for Pattern B (single amount + CR/DR). Deprioritized since mini-statements are typically XLS/CSV downloads.
- **Fixed sign-out 404 on Vercel production** — Sign-out used `window.location.href = '/login'` (hard browser navigation). On Vercel, this returned 404 because no static file exists at `/login`. Created `app/vercel.json` with SPA rewrite rule (`"source": "/(.*)"` → `"/index.html"`) so all client-side routes are served by the React app. Also fixes page refresh on any route (e.g., `/dashboard`).
- **Fixed Privacy/Terms page back button** — Both pages opened via `window.open('/privacy', '_blank')` (new tab) but the back button used `navigate(-1)` which has nowhere to go in a fresh tab. Updated `handleBack` in both pages: checks `window.history.length <= 2` → calls `window.close()` (returns to original tab), with fallback to `navigate('/login')` if close is blocked.
- **DPDA Compliance checklist**

### Key Changes
1. **New files:**
   - `app/vercel.json` — SPA rewrite rule for Vercel deployment (all routes → index.html)

2. **Modified files:**
   - `app/src/modules/dashboard/components/DashboardTab.tsx` — Added `onUncategorizedDrillDown` prop, `uncategorizedCountAll`/`uncategorizedCountThisMonth` state, clickable uncategorized row with chevron, dynamic subtitle "X this month · Y total"
   - `app/src/app/AppLayout.tsx` — Added `drillDownUncategorized` state, `handleUncategorizedDrillDown` callback, passes props to DashboardTab and TransactionsTab
   - `app/src/modules/transactions/components/TransactionsTab.tsx` — Added `drillDownUncategorized` prop, `filterUncategorizedOnly` state, useEffect to consume drill-down, uncategorized-only filter logic in `filteredTransactions`, mutual exclusion with other filters, wired CategoryMultiSelect uncategorized props
   - `app/src/shared/components/CategoryMultiSelect.tsx` — Added `uncategorizedOnly`, `hasUncategorized`, `onToggleUncategorized` props, "All Uncategorised" checkbox in Quick Select with amber styling, searchable by "uncategorised"/"uncategorized"
   - `app/src/modules/budget/services/transactions.ts` — Added `getUncategorizedCount()` function (count-only query, no data transfer)
   - `app/src/modules/transactions/services/csvParser.ts` — Rewrote `GENERIC_CSV.parseRow` to: skip date column in amount scanning, detect CR/DR indicator columns, recognize "Amount" as combined column keyword, skip serial number/ref columns in positional fallback, use CR/DR value for debit/credit direction
   - `app/src/shared/pages/PrivacyPolicyPage.tsx` — Back button uses `handleBack()` with `window.close()` for new-tab context, fallback to `/login`
   - `app/src/shared/pages/TermsPage.tsx` — Same `handleBack()` fix as PrivacyPolicyPage

### Build Status
- TypeScript: ✅ Zero errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- Vite build: ✅ Passes clean

### Still Needed
- ~~**Run migrations `012_consent_tracking.sql` and `013_delete_user_account.sql`** on DEV and PROD Supabase~~
- **Run migration `011_csv_import_support.sql`** on DEV Supabase (from previous session)
- PDF generic parser Pattern B gap (single amount + CR/DR indicator) — low priority
- ~~Create actual /privacy and /terms static pages (currently open to non-existent routes)~~
- Enable PGAudit on Supabase for admin query logging (Tier 1 security recommendation)

### Previous Session 33: Privacy Consent & Data Transparency — DPDPA Compliance
- Added DPDPA-compliant consent collection for new users (ConsentModal during signup)
- Created consent tracking migration (`012_consent_tracking.sql`)
- Added Data & Privacy page (PrivacyInfoModal) accessible from ProfilePanel
- Fixed dead Terms/Privacy links on login screen
- Built "Delete my account & data" feature with SECURITY DEFINER RPC (`013_delete_user_account.sql`)

### Previous Session 32: Bank Statement Import — Real-World Testing & Generic Parser Rewrite
- Tested with real Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Federal Bank (Jupiter) PDFs
- Rewrote generic PDF fallback parser with X-coordinate column clustering
- Fixed bank misdetection, simplified parser strategy
- **Added Excel (.xlsx/.xls) import support** — new `excelParser.ts` using SheetJS, delegates to CSV parser pipeline. ⚠️ NOT YET TESTED with real Excel bank statements

### Previous Session 31: Bank Statement Import — Full Build (PDF + CSV)
- Built complete bank statement import (8 new files, 5 modified)
- PDF + CSV support with merchant matching and multi-step import modal

### Previous Session 30: CSV Import Planning
- Plan approved, saved at `.claude/plans/velvety-knitting-noodle.md`

### MPIN Auth (Session 29 - completed)
- ✅ MPIN auth fully deployed and working on DEV
- ✅ PROD migration instructions provided to user
- ✅ Fixed `email_confirmed_at` issue for migrated OTP users

**Previous Session 29: Replace OTP Login with MPIN-Based Login**

### Auth Architecture Change
Replaced Supabase phone OTP auth (SMS-based, costs per login) with 6-digit MPIN system (zero SMS cost). Phone number remains the identifier, but authentication uses `supabase.auth.signUp/signInWithPassword` with email = `{phone}@my2cents.app` and password = the MPIN.

### New Files Created
- **`supabase/migrations/010_user_pins.sql`** — `user_pins` table, `check_phone_registered` RPC (anon-callable), `reset_user_pin` RPC (SECURITY DEFINER, updates auth.users.encrypted_password + user_pins), migration block for existing OTP users (adds email/password to auth records, preserves user_id)
- **`app/src/modules/auth/components/SetPinScreen.tsx`** — Two-step PIN creation (enter + confirm). Used for both new user signup and PIN reset. Validates PIN strength (rejects all-same-digit, 123456, 654321). Split-screen layout matching existing auth screens.
- **`app/src/modules/auth/components/EnterPinScreen.tsx`** — PIN login screen for existing users. Masked phone display, auto-submit on 6 digits, "Forgot PIN?" link to reset flow.

### Modified Files
- **`auth.ts`** — Removed `sendOTP()`, `verifyOTP()`. Added `phoneToEmail()`, `checkPhoneExists()` (RPC call), `signUpWithPin()`, `signInWithPin()`, `resetPin()` (RPC call). Kept `signOut`, `getOnboardingStatus`, etc unchanged.
- **`PhoneEntryScreen.tsx`** — Now calls `checkPhoneExists()` on Continue, navigates to `/enter-pin` (existing) or `/set-pin` (new) instead of `/verify`.
- **`OTPInput.tsx`** — Added `masked?: boolean` prop with `-webkit-text-security: disc` for PIN dot masking.
- **`Router.tsx`** — Added `/set-pin` and `/enter-pin` routes (PublicRoute-guarded). Removed `/verify` route. OTPScreen import removed.
- **`app.config.ts`** — Added `phone_pin` login method, `pinLength: 6`, `emailDomain: 'my2cents.app'`.
- **`validation.ts`** — Added `validatePin()` (6-digit, rejects trivial PINs) and `maskPhone()` (xxxxx 43210).
- **`ProfilePanel.tsx`** — Phone display reads from `user_metadata.phone_number` (MPIN auth) with fallback to `user.phone` (OTP auth).
- **`onboarding.ts`** — Phone extraction in `updateDisplayName` handles MPIN auth metadata.

### Database Migration (DEV)
- ✅ Ran `010_user_pins.sql` on DEV Supabase (`vcbmazhfcmchbswdcwqr`) — `user_pins` table, `check_phone_registered` RPC, `reset_user_pin` RPC, existing OTP user migration all created successfully.
- ✅ Disabled "Confirm email" in DEV Supabase Auth → Sign In / Providers settings.
- ✅ Tested new user flow: enter phone → detected as new → navigated to "Create your PIN" screen. Working end-to-end.

### Deployment Notes (PROD)
- **Still needed for PROD**: Run `010_user_pins.sql` on PROD Supabase (`qybzttjbjxmqdhcstuif`) and disable email confirmations there.
- **Existing user migration**: Existing OTP users get email + temporary PIN `000000`. Set real PINs via `SELECT reset_user_pin('918130944414@my2cents.app', 'XXXXXX')` in SQL editor.
- **OTPScreen.tsx** is now dead code (not imported anywhere) — can be deleted in a cleanup pass.

### Build Status
- TypeScript: ✅ Zero errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` passes clean)
- Vite build: ✅ Passes clean

**Previous Session 28: CategoryMultiSelect Search-Select, Dashboard Drill-Down, UX Fixes, Demo Data**

### CategoryMultiSelect Improvements
- **Search-select pattern:** Replaced button trigger with input element that serves as both display ("Search categories") and search field. Typing opens dropdown and filters sub-categories by name/category. Size aligned with MemberMultiSelect using explicit `h-[34px]`, `leading-none`, `style={{ fontSize: '12px' }}`.
- **Quick Select shortcuts:** Changed from 2-column grid with color dots to vertical list layout.
- **Search filtering:** Filters sub-categories by name or parent category name, filters shortcuts by type name.

### Dashboard → Transactions Drill-Down
Clicking any sub-category in "Daily Expenses to Watch" or "Overspent Categories" on Dashboard navigates to Transactions tab pre-filtered for that sub-category.
- `AppLayout.tsx`: Added `drillDownSubCategoryId` state, `handleCategoryDrillDown` callback, `handleDrillDownConsumed`
- `DashboardTab.tsx`: Added `onCategoryDrillDown` prop, made rows clickable with chevron icon
- `TransactionsTab.tsx`: Added `drillDownSubCategoryId` and `onDrillDownConsumed` props, useEffect to apply filter on mount
- Filter badge shows active, user can reset filters to return to normal view

### UX Fixes
- **Phone validation:** Inline validation errors shown as user types (not just on disabled Continue click). Added `touched` state and `showInlineError` logic in `PhoneEntryScreen.tsx`.
- **Enter key support:** Name entry (`YourNameScreen.tsx`), household creation both create and join modes (`HouseholdScreen.tsx`) now submit on Enter key.

### Demo Household Seed Data
- Created `supabase/migrations/SEED_DEMO_HOUSEHOLD.sql` for prod demo
- PL/pgSQL DO block with realistic data: 2 users (Ravi & Priya Sharma), full household, 32 sub-categories, frozen budget (₹1,85,000 income / ₹1,72,500 allocated), 60+ transactions
- Dashboard designed to show at-risk categories (Food Ordering 95%, Dining Out 88%, Shopping 82%, Entertainment 77%) and overspent (Electricity 114%)
- 3 fund transfers between members, mix of payment methods
- UUIDs: Ravi=4ee05567, Priya=7466b2f9

**Previous Session 26: Filter Overlay Fix (React Portal) + Glass Design Completion**

### Filter Overlay Fix (Critical Bug)
The filter dropdowns in TransactionsTab and BudgetTab were appearing as "orphaned modals" on the left side of the screen instead of overlaying near the filter button. Root cause: CSS `backdrop-filter` on ancestor elements (`.glass-header`, `.glass-card`) creates containing blocks that trap `fixed` positioned descendants.

**Fix:** Used `ReactDOM.createPortal(dropdown, document.body)` to render filter dropdowns directly at the document root, completely escaping all ancestor containing blocks.

Changes:
- `TransactionsTab.tsx` — Added `createPortal` import; filter dropdown now renders via portal with transparent backdrop for click-outside-to-close; replaced `glass-card glass-card-elevated` with `bg-white rounded-2xl border` (no `backdrop-filter`/`overflow: hidden`)
- `BudgetTab.tsx` — Same portal pattern for budget member filter dropdown

### Glass Design Completion (from Session 25 continuation)
Completed glass design conversion for remaining components:
- `InlineAddItem.tsx` — Full glass design conversion
- `WelcomeCard.tsx` — `bg-primary-gradient`
- `ExpenseSelectionScreen.tsx` — `bg-primary-gradient`
- `InlineAddCategory.tsx` — Full glass design conversion
- `ErrorAlert.tsx` — CSS var danger colors

### Previous Session 25 fixes (preserved)
- Transactions summary card widened
- Income amounts red bleed-through fixed (opaque bg)
- Icon-header padding reduced
- Notification icon removed from Dashboard
- Overspent Categories restructured

### Previous: Sessions 22-24 — Dreamy Glass Design Language

Applied a comprehensive "dreamy glass" design language across the entire My2cents PWA.

### Design Foundation Layer
- **CSS Custom Properties** in `app/src/index.css`: `--color-primary: #7C3AED`, `--color-page-bg`, `--color-success`, `--color-danger`, `--glass-blur`, `--glass-border`, `--glass-shadow`, `--color-primary-bg`, `--color-success-bg`
- **Utility Classes**: `.glass-card`, `.glass-card-elevated`, `.glass-header`, `.glass-nav`, `.bg-primary-gradient`, `.noise-overlay`
- **NoiseOverlay component** (`app/src/shared/components/NoiseOverlay.tsx`): SVG fractal noise texture overlay on page bg
- **GlassCard component** (`app/src/shared/components/GlassCard.tsx`): Reusable frosted glass card

### Files Modified (30+ components)
**Dashboard:** DashboardScreen.tsx, WelcomeCard.tsx, BudgetSection.tsx (dashboard), BudgetItem.tsx (dashboard), InlineAddItem.tsx, QuickAddTransaction.tsx, FundTransferModal.tsx
**Budget:** BudgetTab.tsx, BudgetViewMode.tsx, InlineIncomeSection.tsx, MonthSelector.tsx, CategoryTile.tsx, AmountInput.tsx, InlineAddCategory.tsx, ExpenseSelectionScreen.tsx
**Transactions:** TransactionsTab.tsx
**Auth:** PhoneEntryScreen.tsx, OTPScreen.tsx, SuccessScreen.tsx, OTPInput.tsx, PhoneInput.tsx
**Onboarding:** YourNameScreen.tsx, HouseholdScreen.tsx, InviteScreen.tsx
**Shared:** ProfilePanel.tsx, Toast.tsx, MemberMultiSelect.tsx, ErrorAlert.tsx, Input.tsx, NavItem.tsx, ProgressDots.tsx
**App:** Router.tsx (LoadingScreen)

### Design Conversion Patterns Applied
- `bg-stone-50` → `bg-[var(--color-page-bg)]`
- `bg-white rounded-xl` → `glass-card`
- `bg-white border-b` headers → `glass-header`
- `bg-purple-600/700/800` buttons → `bg-primary-gradient` with shadow `shadow-[0_4px_16px_rgba(124,58,237,0.3)]` + hover lift
- `rounded-lg` → `rounded-xl` throughout
- `text-purple-XXX` → `text-[var(--color-primary)]`
- Modal backdrops → `bg-black/40 backdrop-blur-sm`
- Modal cards → `bg-white/90 backdrop-blur-xl rounded-t-3xl md:rounded-2xl`
- Inputs → `border-[rgba(124,58,237,0.15)] rounded-xl bg-white/75` with glass focus ring
- Dropdowns → `bg-white/90 backdrop-blur-xl` with glass shadow
- Emojis in headers → SVG line icons in `rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-primary-bg)]` containers
- Hover states → `hover:bg-white/40` or `hover:bg-white/60`
- Borders → `border-[rgba(124,58,237,0.06)]` for separators

### Build Status
- TypeScript: ✅ Zero errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` passes clean)
- Zero hardcoded `purple-` or `indigo-` class references in any `.tsx` file (only in comments)

### Key Decisions Made
- Auth: Phone + OTP via Supabase (no email, no passwords)
- Partner invite: QR code → phone camera scan → Finny link → Phone + OTP
- Onboarding: 4 screens (Phone+OTP → Name → Household → Category Template)
- Income: A category in the plan template, not a separate step
- Opening balance: Sub-category under Income, defaults to ₹0
- Savings preference: Deferred — asked when user first needs bucket features
- Bank account registration: Deferred to P1 (reconciliation)
- Over-allocation: Blocked — cannot freeze plan if allocated > income
- Plan required: Cannot record transactions without a frozen plan
- Feature toggles: household_settings table from day one
- Starter template: Income (6 suggestions, Salary pre-selected), EMIs (4), Insurance (3), Savings (4), Fixed (6), Variable (12), Family (empty), Investment (empty), One-time (empty)
- Configurability: Flexible key-value settings table, central registry at `docs/settings-registry.md`

## In Progress
- [x] **Bank Statement Import (Pillar 1: Productivity)** — ✅ Code complete + tested with real statements
  - Plan at: `.claude/plans/velvety-knitting-noodle.md`
  - All implementation steps complete + real-world testing done
  - Supports: PDF, CSV, **Excel (.xlsx/.xls)** — ✅ Excel tested with real ICICI mini-statement XLS (Session 34)
  - Tested banks: ✅ Axis (bank-specific), ✅ ICICI (bank-specific + Excel), ✅ Federal/Jupiter (generic fallback)
  - Generic parser handles both patterns: Pattern A (split Debit/Credit columns) and Pattern B (single Amount + CR/DR indicator)
  - ⚠️ PDF generic parser has gap for Pattern B (low priority — mini-statements are typically XLS/CSV)
  - Untested bank parsers commented out (HDFC, SBI, Kotak) — will uncomment after real statement validation
  - Dependencies: `pdfjs-dist` (PDF), `papaparse` (CSV), `xlsx` (Excel), `@types/papaparse`
  - **Action needed:** Run migration `011_csv_import_support.sql` on DEV Supabase before full testing

## Blocked / Waiting
- Nothing currently blocked

## Deferred Decisions (User to revisit after living with the app)
- **FAB income flow:** Currently FAB can only add income against existing sub-categories. User wants Option 2 (inline sub-category creation for income in QuickAdd) but deferred the UX decision (how to distinguish income vs expense input). Revisit after daily usage.
- **Income transaction date:** When income is recorded in budget edit mode, the date defaults to today (`new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]`). User may want to specify a different date (e.g., salary received on a specific date). Revisit after daily usage.
- **FAB for income recording:** Evaluate whether income should be recordable through the FAB (floating action button) at all. Currently income is only recorded inline during budget edit mode. FAB could provide a quicker path for recording income outside of budget planning. Revisit after daily usage.
- **Voice-based budget setup:** Simplify budget setup through voice instructions. User mentioned as future task.

---

## Known Issues

- [x] ~~Suggestion clicks not working (EMI and other categories)~~ - FIXED (onMouseDown + preventDefault pattern)
- [x] ~~Frozen plan showing stale data without refresh~~ - FIXED (flush pending saves before freeze)
- [x] ~~Budget health card cramped with 6-digit amounts~~ - FIXED (responsive font sizing: 26px for ₹1,00,000+)
- [ ] PWA manifest/service worker not yet added
- [ ] Custom category creation disabled (commented out, needs proper UX design)

## Session Log

| Date | What was done |
|------|---------------|
| 2026-03-01 | **Session 40 (Notifications use case definition):** Pure product design session — no code changes. Defined 5 notification types (Release Updates, Expense Logging Reminders, Budget Creation Reminders, Add to Homescreen, Tutorials). Fully defined Release Updates: in-app "What's New" swipeable carousel + push to pull back inactive users, content in Supabase table. Fully defined Expense Logging Reminders: Duolingo-style gamified approach with Track A (zero txns today, escalating across days) and Track B (contextual nudges, max 2-3/day). Wrote custom sassy hook+action messages for all ~30 predefined sub-categories with specific triggers/frequencies. Generic messages for custom sub-cats. Created `docs/Finny-Foundation-Pillar/finny-user-journey-notifications.md`. Remaining: Budget Creation Reminders (#3), Add to Homescreen (#4), Tutorials (#5), architecture design. |
| 2026-03-01 | **Session 39 (Bug fix + deploy):** Fixed stale QuickAdd categories — sub-categories weren't refreshing when modal opened, causing newly created sub-categories to be missing. Added useEffect on all 3 tabs to refresh from DB when QuickAdd opens. Removed destructive orphan cleanup in BudgetTab.loadEditData() that permanently deleted expense sub-categories from household_sub_categories based on a single month's missing allocations (data loss bug). Also deployed Session 38 perf optimizations (query waterfall elimination). Modified: BudgetTab.tsx, DashboardTab.tsx, TransactionsTab.tsx. Deployed to prod (commit `7fc812f`). |
| 2026-02-28 | **Session 38 (Performance Optimization Phases 1-3, 5):** App was taking 7-8s to load with 35-40 Supabase queries per session. Created HouseholdProvider that loads household data once and caches for all tabs (~20 queries eliminated). Updated DashboardTab, BudgetTab, TransactionsTab, ProfilePanel, BudgetProvider to use useHousehold() context. Parallelized AuthProvider onboarding check (Promise.all). Added optional `providedUserMap` param to getTransactions(), getActualIncomeForMonth(), getBudgetViewData() — skips nested user lookups when map provided. Parallelized getHouseholdSubCategories() and getCategoryList() in budget.ts. New: HouseholdProvider.tsx. Modified: App.tsx, AuthProvider.tsx, BudgetProvider.tsx, DashboardTab.tsx, BudgetTab.tsx, TransactionsTab.tsx, ProfilePanel.tsx, transactions.ts, budget.ts. TypeScript passes clean. Phase 4 (tab-level caching) deferred. Not yet deployed — needs browser testing. |
| 2026-02-22 | **Session 34 (uncategorized drill-down, filter enhancements, Excel fix & prod fixes):** Five items: (1) Dashboard uncategorized drill-down — clicking "Uncategorised" row navigates to Transactions tab filtered to uncategorized-only. (2) "All Uncategorised" quick select in CategoryMultiSelect with amber styling, mutual exclusion with other filters. Dashboard subtitle now shows "X this month · Y total". (3) Critical Excel import bug fix — ICICI mini-statement XLS was showing serial numbers as amounts. Rewrote `GENERIC_CSV.parseRow` to handle both Pattern A (split Debit/Credit) and Pattern B (single Amount + CR/DR indicator). (4) Fixed sign-out 404 on Vercel prod — created `app/vercel.json` with SPA rewrite rule so all client-side routes serve index.html. (5) Fixed Privacy/Terms page back button — pages opened in new tab had no history for `navigate(-1)`. Now uses `window.close()` for new-tab context with fallback to `/login`. Modified: DashboardTab.tsx, AppLayout.tsx, TransactionsTab.tsx, CategoryMultiSelect.tsx, transactions.ts, csvParser.ts, PrivacyPolicyPage.tsx, TermsPage.tsx. New: vercel.json. TypeScript + build pass clean. |
| 2026-02-22 | **Session 33 (privacy consent & data transparency):** Added DPDPA-compliant consent collection for new users. ConsentModal shows during signup (5 privacy commitments, data summary, checkbox). Created `012_consent_tracking.sql` migration (consent_accepted, consent_accepted_at, consent_version on users table). Consent flows through full signup chain: PhoneEntryScreen → ConsentModal → SetPinScreen → YourNameScreen → onboarding service. Added PrivacyInfoModal (7 data practices, stored vs. not-stored grid, DPDPA compliance note) accessible from ProfilePanel "Data & Privacy" button. Fixed dead Terms/Privacy links on login screen. New files: ConsentModal.tsx, PrivacyInfoModal.tsx, 012_consent_tracking.sql. Modified: PhoneEntryScreen.tsx, SetPinScreen.tsx, YourNameScreen.tsx, onboarding.ts, ProfilePanel.tsx. TypeScript + build pass clean. |
| 2026-02-22 | **Session 32 (bank statement import testing & generic parser rewrite):** Tested with real Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, and Federal Bank (Jupiter) PDF statements. Rewrote generic PDF fallback parser to use raw TextItem[][] with X-coordinate column clustering instead of pre-mapped TableRow[] cells — fixes parsing failures on unknown bank formats. Fixed Federal Bank misdetection as Axis Bank (IFSC prefix check, require "tran date" header). User decision: keep bank-specific parsers only for tested banks (ICICI, Axis), commented out HDFC+SBI PDF parsers and HDFC+SBI+Kotak CSV parsers (untested). All other banks fall through to generic. Added Vite LAN access for phone testing. Added Excel (.xlsx/.xls) import support — new `excelParser.ts` using SheetJS (xlsx), converts sheets to CSV-like rows and delegates to existing CSV parser pipeline. Excel support NOT YET TESTED with real bank statements. Refactored CSV parser to extract shared `parseCSVRows()` reused by both CSV and Excel parsers. TypeScript passes clean. |
| 2026-02-21 | **Session 31 (bank statement import build):** Built complete bank statement import feature (PDF + CSV). User pivoted to PDF-primary (mobile convenience). Installed pdfjs-dist + papaparse. Created 8 new files: DB migration (source/original_narration columns), merchant rules (21 Indian categories), merchant matcher, PDF parser (3-layer: text extraction → table reconstruction → bank-specific parsing for HDFC/ICICI/SBI/Generic), CSV parser (6 bank formats), import orchestration service, multi-step import modal (upload→preview→import→done with glass design), StatementImportModal.tsx. Modified 5 files: types.ts (nullable sub_category_id, import types), transactions.ts (uncategorized display, source tracking), TransactionsTab.tsx (import button, amber badge, modal integration), QuickAddTransaction.tsx (bank description field, null category in edit), DashboardTab.tsx (uncategorized in daily velocity, "Uncategorised" row in expenses to watch). TypeScript + build pass clean. PDF.js properly code-split (404KB lazy chunk). Migration 011 needs to run on DEV before testing. |
| 2026-02-20 | **Session 30 (CSV import planning):** Researched Indian data security laws (DPDPA 2023, IT Act, SPDI Rules) — minimal compliance at current scale. Checked Supabase data residency (DEV=Seoul, PROD=Singapore, neither in India). Evaluated SMS parsing (blocked by Google Play for PWA), CSV upload (zero cost), UPI integration (heavy compliance). Decision: start with CSV bank statement import. Designed comprehensive plan: 6 new files (migration, merchant rules, merchant matcher, CSV parser, import service, import modal) + 5 modified files (types, transactions service, TransactionsTab, DashboardTab, QuickAddTransaction). Key design: uncategorized transactions stay in normal list with amber badge, treated as expenses, shown in dashboard. Merchant matching via static keyword→sub-category-name rules for Indian merchants. Bank format auto-detection from headers (HDFC, ICICI, SBI, Kotak, Axis). Plan approved — build starts next session. |
| 2026-02-18 | **Session 29 (OTP → MPIN auth):** Replaced Supabase phone OTP auth with 6-digit MPIN system to eliminate SMS costs. Created `user_pins` table + 2 RPC functions (`check_phone_registered`, `reset_user_pin` with SECURITY DEFINER). Auth uses `signUp/signInWithPassword` with email=`{phone}@my2cents.app`, password=PIN. New screens: `SetPinScreen.tsx` (2-step PIN creation, reused for reset), `EnterPinScreen.tsx` (PIN login with "Forgot PIN?" link). Modified: `auth.ts` (removed sendOTP/verifyOTP, added PIN-based functions), `PhoneEntryScreen.tsx` (checks phone existence, routes to set-pin or enter-pin), `OTPInput.tsx` (added `masked` prop), `Router.tsx` (new routes, removed /verify), `app.config.ts` (phone_pin login method), `validation.ts` (validatePin, maskPhone), `ProfilePanel.tsx` + `onboarding.ts` (phone from user_metadata). Migration SQL includes existing OTP user migration preserving user_ids. Ran migration on DEV Supabase + disabled email confirmations. Tested new user flow end-to-end — working. TypeScript + build pass clean. |
| 2026-02-15 | **Session 27 (unified sub-category filter):** Replaced the Type filter (Income/Expense/Transfer toggle buttons) in Transactions tab with a unified sub-category multiselect dropdown (`CategoryMultiSelect.tsx`). Sub-categories grouped by parent category with "Quick Select" shortcuts at top (All Income, All Expenses, All Transfers). Indeterminate checkbox state for partial selections. Fund transfers as special entry (sub_category_id = null). OR logic across categories. State changed from `filterTypes: TransactionType[]` to `filterSubCategoryIds: Set<string>` + `filterIncludeTransfers: boolean`. TypeScript passes clean. Revert available via git commit `71d3c01`. |
| 2026-02-15 | **Session 25 (UI polish from testing):** Fixed 7 issues from real-device screenshots: (1) Transactions filter overlay — changed from `absolute` to `fixed` positioning, (2) Budget filter overlay — same fix for mobile, (3) Transactions summary card widened — more padding, larger icons, left-aligned text, (4) Budget edit income amounts red — changed semi-transparent `bg-white/40` to opaque `bg-white` so swipe-to-delete red bg doesn't bleed through, (5) Reduced icon-header padding in InlineIncomeSection + BudgetSection (`gap-1.5`→`gap-1`, icon `w-7`→`w-6`), (6) Removed notification bell icon from DashboardTab mobile header, (7) Overspent Categories moved outside card to match "Daily Expenses to Watch" pattern (heading+icon outside, items in separate card). TypeScript passes clean. |
| 2026-02-15 | **Sessions 22-24 (dreamy glass design language):** Full app reskin with glass morphism design language. Built CSS foundation (custom properties, utility classes like `.glass-card`, `.glass-header`, `.bg-primary-gradient`, NoiseOverlay/GlassCard components). Systematically converted 30+ components across all screens: Dashboard (DashboardScreen, WelcomeCard, BudgetSection, BudgetItem, InlineAddItem, QuickAddTransaction, FundTransferModal), Budget (BudgetTab, BudgetViewMode, InlineIncomeSection, MonthSelector, CategoryTile, AmountInput, InlineAddCategory, ExpenseSelectionScreen), Transactions (TransactionsTab), Auth (PhoneEntryScreen, OTPScreen, SuccessScreen, OTPInput, PhoneInput), Onboarding (YourNameScreen, HouseholdScreen, InviteScreen), Shared (ProfilePanel, Toast, MemberMultiSelect, ErrorAlert, Input, NavItem, ProgressDots), App (Router LoadingScreen). Replaced all emojis in modal headers with SVG line icons. Zero hardcoded purple/indigo references remain. TypeScript passes clean. |
| 2026-02-15 | **Session 21 (multiselect filter + deploy):** Iterated member filter UI 3x based on user feedback: pills → filter icon + pills → filter icon + multiselect dropdown. Created shared `MemberMultiSelect` component (`app/src/shared/components/MemberMultiSelect.tsx`) — select-like input with checkboxes dropdown, max-h scroll for large lists, click-outside-to-close. Applied to both BudgetTab (filter icon + dropdown panel) and TransactionsTab (renamed "Recorded By" → "Members"). Changed `filterMemberId` (single) → `filterMemberIds` (array). Fixed budget filter panel: removed `overflow-hidden` (was clipping dropdown), increased spacing (`mb-1` → `mb-4`). Deployed commit `71d3c01`. Updated deferred decisions (income date). Added new near-term tasks (dashboard drill-down, category/subcategory filters in trx tab). |
| 2026-02-15 | **Session 20 (member filter on budget tab):** Added member filter pills ("All" + member names) to budget view mode header — desktop: after edit pencil, mobile: below month selector row. Added `filterMemberId` state to BudgetTab, `rawTransactions` passthrough from `getActualsBySubCategory` → `getBudgetViewData` → BudgetViewMode. When filtered: expense actuals recomputed from raw transactions per member, income items filtered by `loggedBy`, totals recalculated. Planned amounts unchanged (household-level). Type check passes clean. |
| 2026-02-15 | **Session 19 (dashboard card renames + income date fix):** Renamed "Budget Health" → "Left to Spend" (removed redundant "Left this month" subtitle). Renamed "Combined Cash Balance" → "Total Cash in Hand" (added subtitle "Total income v/s actual expense"). Fixed "Split by Members" button alignment to top-right (`items-center` → `items-start`). Fixed income transaction date from hardcoded 1st-of-month to actual recording date (`new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]`). Analyzed FAB income flow limitations — deferred improvement decision. All type checks pass. |
| 2026-02-15 | **Session 18 (section header styling + unplanned income wording):** Applied `bg-purple-100` to all 4 section headers (edit mode income/expense, view mode income/expense) with progressive hierarchy (section=`bg-purple-100`, category=`bg-purple-50`). Moved unplanned income indicator to left-aligned subtitle under Expenses heading ("₹X left to plan" green / "₹X over income" red). Updated column label colors to `text-purple-400`. |
| 2026-02-15 | **Session 17 (two-step add income + fixes + mobile layout):** Rewrote "Add income" flow to match expense UX: Step 1 = text input + suggestion chips (not dropdown), Step 2 = amount input + "By" selector. Custom names create sub-categories on the fly. Removed "Editing Mode" banner (wastes space). Changed headings: "Income" → "Record your income", "Expenses" → "Plan your expenses". Fixed critical freeze bug: `handleFreezePlan` was calling `upsertMonthlyPlan` with stale income from React state, causing ceiling error. Fixed mobile heading wrapping: kept full sentences, used compact amount (text-xs + "/mo"). Added unplanned income (AI-PE) as subtext under Expenses header in view mode (green=surplus, red=over-planned). All type checks pass. |
| 2026-02-15 | **Session 16 (inline income editing):** Redesigned budget edit mode based on user feedback. Previous step-based flow (separate IncomeRecordingForm → expense planner) was "very convoluted" for repeat edits. Created `InlineIncomeSection.tsx` — collapsible section mirroring BudgetSection pattern with inline amount editing, delete, "+ Add income" with source dropdown/suggestions/member selector. Simplified BudgetTab flow from 3-step (`income → expenses → view`) to 2-step (`edit \| view`). In edit mode, Income + Expenses sections appear together — both editable in the same view. Deleted dead `IncomeRecordingForm.tsx`. All type checks pass. Tested on desktop and mobile. |
| 2026-02-14 | **Session 15 (remove planned income):** Major architectural change — removed Planned Income (PI) from budget model. Income is now ONLY recorded as actual transactions, not plan allocations. 5-phase implementation: (1) Added `getActualIncomeForMonth()` to transactions.ts, modified `getBudgetViewData()` to return income from transactions + expenses only from allocations. (2) Created new `IncomeRecordingForm.tsx` component for recording income as transactions. (3) Refactored BudgetTab.tsx with step-based flow (`income → expenses → view`), removed all income allocation state/handlers, freeze validation checks actual income from transactions. (4) Updated BudgetViewMode.tsx — income section shows actual transactions in collapsible header. (5) Cleaned ~560 lines of dead code: removed `saveIncomeProgress()`, `loadIncomeProgress()`, `completeBudgetSetup()` from budget.ts; removed `getIncomeTemplates()`, `getDefaultIncomeSelections()` from defaultCategories.ts; deleted dead IncomeSelectionScreen.tsx and IncomeAmountsScreen.tsx. Also in prior portion of session: fixed fund transfer modal, pre-loaded household users, added fund transfer support to Budget tab, multi-select type filter, performance optimization (parallelized Supabase calls), deployed. All type checks pass clean. |
| 2026-02-14 | **Session 14 (documentation audit):** Compared entire codebase against all documentation and fixed every discrepancy found. Updated 13 files total: database-schema.md (added transactions/household_categories tables, updated categories 7→9), finny-user-journey-onboarding.md (OTP 4→6 digits, Finny→My2cents, Inter→Poppins, added status banner), finny-solution-doc-foundation-pillar.md (added build status to all 8 sections, fixed auth method, updated categories), finny-design-system.md (marked DEPRECATED), my2cents-design-system.md (primary purple-600→purple-800), finny-foundations.md (Finny→My2cents, noted app is live), finny-roadmap.md (Finny→My2cents, added progress annotations), settings-registry.md (noted household_settings table not built), skills-developer.md (updated code organization tree & TS conventions to match reality), skills-design.md (updated navigation description), DEPLOYMENT.md (updated migrations list, actual URLs, phone auth details), archived DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md/NEXT-STEPS-DEV-SETUP.md. Removed stale Next Up items. Updated CLAUDE.md branding. |
| 2026-02-13 | **Session 13 (new categories & critical fixes):** Added Family & Investment expense categories (9 total categories now). Fixed critical suggestion click bug across all categories using onMouseDown + preventDefault pattern. Implemented responsive font sizing (26px for 6+ digits) in budget health card. Fixed stale data bug by flushing pending saves before plan freeze. Fixed subcategory creation for custom categories with dual table lookup (categories + household_categories tables). Updated migrations: ADD_CUSTOM_CATEGORIES.sql (household_categories table), ADD_FAMILY_INVESTMENT_CATEGORIES.sql (new categories). Deployed to production successfully (commit b1a727a). Verified with existing production users - all data preserved. Custom category creation temporarily disabled (commented out) pending better UX design. |
| 2026-02-12 | **Session 12 (dev/prod separation & deployment):** Deployed to Vercel, debugged auth errors, set up dev/prod database separation. Deployed My2cents to Vercel (beta-test project, URL: https://beta-test-five.vercel.app). Fixed "unsupported phone provider" and "invalid API key" errors (missing Vercel env vars). Created separate Supabase databases: renamed "My2Cents" → "My2Cents-prod" (production, qybzttjbjxmqdhcstuif), "My2Cents-prod" → "My2Cents-dev" (development, vcbmazhfcmchbswdcwqr). Updated local `.env.local` to use DEV database. Vercel prod uses PROD database. Created setup guide. Still need to: copy schema to DEV, configure phone auth on DEV, test local with DEV database. |
| 2026-02-11 | **Session 11 (dashboard redesign & UI polish):** Redesigned dashboard with 3 clean cards (Budget Health, Daily Spending, Expected Cash Balance) using progressive disclosure. Fixed transaction amount input - changed from inline rupee symbol to standard boxed input field like other form fields. Implemented smart color gradients in Budget view: Variable category shows yellow→orange→red gradient (75-89-100%+), other expenses only red when >100%, income green when exceeding planned. Added red dotted underline for over-budget items (not for income). Fixed column alignment by removing warning icon. Added negative amount display with (-) prefix for deficits in Dashboard. Implemented Enter key submit throughout transaction form. Renamed "Your Cash Balance" to "Your Expected Cash Balance". |
| 2026-02-10 | **Session 10 (bug fixes):** Fixed confetti not showing - changed first-freeze detection to query DB for existing frozen plans instead of relying on availableMonths state. Fixed tabs not unlocking - corrected BudgetProvider month format from YYYY-MM to YYYY-MM-01, added 500ms delay before refetch. Changed sidebar default to collapsed. Mobile access: use `npm run dev -- --host` to expose on local network. |
| 2026-02-10 | **Session 10 (continued):** Added debounced auto-save for budget drafts (1 second delay after last change). Shows "Draft saved" green badge when saved. Implemented confetti animation (50 falling pieces) + success modal on first budget freeze. Budget tab calls `refetchBudgetStatus()` after freeze to unlock Dashboard & Transactions tabs. Added Confetti component with falling animation keyframes. Complete flow now works: Onboarding → Budget (tabs locked) → Edit & save → Freeze → Confetti 🎉 → Success modal → Tabs unlock. |
| 2026-02-10 | **Session 10:** Implemented budget-first UX. Created BudgetProvider to track frozen budget status. Updated BottomNav, SideNav, and NavItem components with lock state UI (grayed out + lock icon overlay on Dashboard & Transactions when no frozen budget). FAB disabled when budget not frozen. Updated Dashboard empty state with clear unlock messaging and info banner. Changed default landing tab from Dashboard to Budget. |
| 2026-02-10 | **Session 9:** Fixed critical onboarding bug. Supabase Auth persists user metadata even after user deletion, causing returning users to skip onboarding. Changed onboarding check to be database-first: AuthProvider and getOnboardingStatus() now query `users` and `household_members` tables instead of trusting auth metadata. New users now correctly land in onboarding flow. Created single-query data reset script for testing. |
| 2026-02-10 | **Session 8:** Fixed transaction filter bugs: separate refs for mobile/desktop filter dropdowns (click-outside detection now works correctly), date inputs constrained with max date (can't filter by future dates), removed unused `onOpenMenu` prop from TransactionsTab. Cleaned up ALL pre-existing TypeScript errors across codebase: fixed icon type mismatches by adding fallback values (`icon \|\| '📦'`), removed unused imports and variables (useEffect, getRecentSubCategories, formatDateDisplay, etc.), fixed `planned_expense` → `total_allocated` property access. App now builds with zero TypeScript errors. |
| 2026-02-10 | **Session 7:** Built 3-tab navigation (Dashboard, Budget, Transactions) with mobile bottom nav + desktop sidebar. Added center FAB in mobile nav. Created TransactionsTab with grouped list, sleek card design, edit/delete functionality. Built QuickAddTransaction modal supporting add and edit modes. Added income categories to selector with visual indicator. Implemented transaction filters (date range, recorded by multiselect, type) in header dropdown. Updated types and services to include logged_by_name. Some filter issues remain. |
| 2026-02-09 | **Session 6:** Connected real Supabase auth. Created Supabase project with phone auth test mode. Removed ALL demo mode code from codebase. Changed OTP to 6 digits. Updated all screens with responsive split-screen layout (purple branding left, cream form right). Created database tables (users, households, household_members) with RLS. Fixed QR code localhost issue with prominent invite code display. Full onboarding flow now works with real auth. |
| 2026-02-09 | **Session 5:** Fixed Tailwind v4 CSS issue. Custom color tokens weren't generating utility classes. Rewrote all components (Button, Input, Card, Logo, ErrorAlert, PhoneInput, OTPInput, OTPScreen, SuccessScreen, YourNameScreen, HouseholdScreen, InviteScreen, ProgressDots, Router) to use standard Tailwind colors (purple-800, amber-400, stone-50, gray-*). Simplified tailwind.config.js. App now renders correctly. |
| 2026-02-09 | **Session 4:** Implemented My2cents design system in the React app. Updated Tailwind config with new design tokens (plum, honey, cream, sand colors). Changed font from Inter to Poppins. Updated all shared components (Button, Input, Card, Logo, ErrorAlert). Updated all auth screens (PhoneEntryScreen, OTPScreen, SuccessScreen) with responsive layout. Updated all onboarding screens (YourNameScreen, HouseholdScreen, InviteScreen) with responsive layout. Removed phone-frame mockup styling — now proper mobile-first responsive PWA. Updated branding from Finny to My2cents throughout. Build passes successfully. To test: `cd app && npm run dev`, use OTP code `1234`. |
| 2026-02-09 | **Session 3:** Complete brand identity redesign. Renamed app from "Finny" to "My2cents". Explored multiple design directions, reviewed reference designs (budget_app_brand_concepts, dugoutleague.com). Created and compared two color variants (Muted Plum vs Electric Purple). Final decision: Muted Plum (#6A4C6B) with Poppins typography. Created comprehensive design system document at `docs/my2cents-design-system.md`. |
| 2026-02-09 | **Session 2:** Built complete onboarding app in `app/`. Created Vite+React+TS project. Configured Tailwind v4 with design tokens. Built shared components (Button, Input, Card, ErrorAlert, Logo). Created auth module (PhoneInput, OTPInput, 3 screens). Created onboarding module (ProgressDots, 3 screens with QR code). Implemented AuthProvider with demo mode (sessionStorage). Added Router with auth guards. Fixed "failed to fetch" error with demo mode. Applied phone frame styling to all screens. App builds successfully. |
| 2026-02-09 | **Session 1:** Added configurability framework: created `docs/settings-registry.md` with P0 + display params. Updated skills-pm.md (simplicity principle, solutioning checklist). Updated skills-architect.md (settings schema pattern). Updated CLAUDE.md (configurability in key decisions). |
| 2026-02-08 | Created all product docs (foundations, roadmap, solution, user journey for onboarding). Created CLAUDE.md, 4 skill files, progress.md. No code yet. |
